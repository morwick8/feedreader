# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds as well as a shell for set of Jasmine test suites. The RSS feed reader website has a slide-menu hidden off-screen until the user presses a hamburger icon.  The slide-menu reveal the list of feeds.  When the user selects a feed, the main page is populated with recent entries listed from the feed's URL.


## Test Suites

The test suites performed in this Jasmine specrunner.html include: RSS Feeds - which makes sure RSS feeds are found,
The Menu - which makes sure the menu icon shows the Feeds menu and hides it again on an additional mouseclick,
Initial entries - which tests to make sure feed entries actually load, and
New Feed Selection - which tests to make sure new content is loaded after the initial content loads.


## How to Use

In order to use these Jasmine test suites, you need to do the following:

1. Go to https://morwick8/feedreader and clone the git repository.
2. The RSS Feed Reader website can be accessed by opening the "index.html" file in your browser.
3. You can see which Jasmine tests have been run and their results by scrolling to the bottom of the "index.html" page or by opening the "specrunner.html" file in your browser.
4. To modify or add additional tests, you can edit the "jasmine/spec/feedreader.js" file.

Enjoy, and happy testing!
